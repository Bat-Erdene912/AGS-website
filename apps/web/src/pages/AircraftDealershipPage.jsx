                  The Company I.C.P. is located in the north of Italy, in Piedmont region. It was founded in 1980 as a family business, whose main activity was the production of wiring for the electrical appliance and electromechanical sector. Since 1984, the company specialized in design and production of wear indicators for friction materials for disc and drum brakes of cars, industrial vehicles and motorcycles, as well as wiring in the same sectors.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This activity, thanks to the curiosity and passion of the founder, was accompanied in 1988 by the importation of Chickinox ultralight aircraft and the following year I.C.P. started marketing and sales of ultralight aircraft in aluminum alloy produced by Zenair.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1990 I.C.P. start producing with a licence agreeement the aforementioned aircraft and starting from 1996, while continuing the collaboration with Zenair, I.C.P. begins to design and produce its own aircraft with unique characteristics of robustness and versatility, now known worldwide for their high safety standards.

                      We have produced approximately 1000 units of Savannah S, since its first launch on the market in 2010 and it was time to take flight the project we had been working on for some time.

                    <p>
                      We took the opportunity of this restyling to redesign the entire aircraft and all its components in 3D in order to standardize and improve the assembly manuals, the spare parts catalog and all the technical documents.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The primary objective of this project was to change some imperfection of the aircraft and put into practice the suggestions reported by the sales network and users in general, in order to harmonize the technical documentation in compliance with the new 600 kg MTOW European regulations, in order to receive rapid approval by the CAA of each country.

                      The Ventura is the latest creation by I.C.P. in order of time, and is the result of in-depth studies aimed at satisfying the growing market demand for a larger aircraft, with more space and greater load capacity. As per tradition, it is a high-wing aircraft of entirely metallic construction, made with cutting-edge industrial technologies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The large wing with Riblett GA 35-418 profile guarantees the excellent STOL qualities that are a hallmark of the I.C.P. aircraft, while the landing gear with the front steering wheel allows an easy movement at ground.

                    <p>
                      Once on board, it will be possible to appreciate the wide cabin space, the comfort of the adjustable seats that can satisfy pilots of all sizes and the huge rear space that allows you to load up to 90 kg of luggages.
